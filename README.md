# The Open Metric

With the introduction of Open Science and the increase of scientific research accessibility, the current metrics to measure relevance or success within the research community are rapidly becoming obsolete. These academic metrics aim to represent the dissemination of knowledge among scientists rather than the impact of the research on the wider world. There is, therefore, a lack of metrics to measure the effectiveness and impact of science. 

The Open Metric is a new measurement system that allows scientists to assess the effectiveness of their open science activities, such as journal articles, social media or news appearances, and outreach activities. It also allows independent researchers, especially those from developing countries, to identify the reproducibility of a specific research project and plan for future research. The Open Metric takes different input factors to compute a final value that effectively identifies the openness, engagement, and impact of any journal article, data repository, or scientific outreach activity.

## Input factors and weights

The Open Metric takes the following input factors and weights into account:

- **Credibility (50%)**: Measured using the citation index, which takes into account the number of times this specific content has been cited in scientific articles or scientific media. This value has a weight of 50%, since it is highly effective to measure the impact on new scientific projects and outcomes.
- **Accessibility (25%)**: Considers if it has been published under a pay-per-view format or it is open access and free. This factor has a weight of 25%, which highlights the importance of the parameter when measuring the potentially social impact of scientific work, especially towards developing countries.
- **Societal engagement (25%)**: Divided between social media interaction and online reader behavior, incorporates the social impact of the content. This factor has a weight of 25%, divided into 15% for social media interaction, considering both the post numbers and the reactions, and a 10% for online reader behavior, which is characterized by the time spent by readers on the content.

All these factors play a key role in the social impact and effectiveness of open science activities, and are therefore included in the Open Metric.

## Improvements

There are still a lot of things that could be improved in the Open Metric, such as:

- For the accessibility factor, it will be more holistic to include the proportion of referenced content that is open and free aside from only scoring between paid and free content. This will make it more comprehensive since it will allow independent researchers to check whether resources to reproduce the work are accessible.
- The inclusion of citations in patents for the credibility factor. This will show how a research work is solid enough to encourage technological transfer and scientifically support inventions.
- For societal engagement, it will be ideal to gather data on online reader behavior, such as the time spent by readers on the content.

## How to use

From the individual Open Metric, which is given to each content type as described above, a normalized metric could be used for both scientific journals, conferences, and also for individual scientists or research groups.
